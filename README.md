# Speeding Tickets Display

This project is a simple web application that displays speeding ticket data recorded on July 4th, 2014. It uses a JSON data file to populate a table that shows details such as the ticket date, time, actual speed, posted speed, speed over the limit, the violator's age, and sex. The front end is built with Vue.js and styled with Bootstrap.
